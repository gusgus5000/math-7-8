## 🎯 Critical Instructions for Claude

When you run `/init` in this project:

1. **THINK FIRST** - Use `think` to plan the architecture before coding
2. Create the exact file structure shown below
3. Install all dependencies listed
4. Set up configuration files with the specified settings
5. Create a working "Hello World" example
6. Verify everything works with the test command

## 📦 Dependencies to Install

### Production Dependencies
```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

### Dev Dependencies
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer eslint prettier
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### tailwind.config.ts
```typescript
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
export default config
```

### .env.example
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# API Keys
# Add your API keys here
```

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Preferences

### Coding Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Write self-documenting code
- Use early returns for clarity
- Comprehensive error handling

### Claude Behavior
- Explain complex architectural decisions
- Ask before making major changes
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Follow existing code patterns

### Git Workflow
- Commits: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- Branches: feature/branch-name

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Framework: Playwright (E2E)

- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Test across multiple browsers
- Visual regression testing
- API testing capabilities

## 🎨 UI Development

### Styling
- Approach: Tailwind CSS
- Component Library: shadcn/ui

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Create reusable component classes with @apply
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- Never commit .env files
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper authentication
- Enable CORS appropriately
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular dependency updates
- SQL injection prevention (if using SQL)
- XSS protection

## 📝 Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Testing
npm test
npm test:watch

# Building
npm run build

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## ✅ GitHub CLI Detected

Great! You have GitHub CLI installed. Claude can use it for:
- Creating and managing pull requests
- Reading and creating issues  
- Handling GitHub operations
- Code review automation

No additional setup needed!



## 🛠️ Recommended Tool Allowlist

Consider allowing these tools in Claude Code for smoother workflow:

```bash
# In Claude Code, use /permissions to add:
- Edit
- Write
- Bash(npm:*)
- Bash(yarn:*)
- Bash(pnpm:*)
- Bash(test:*)
- Bash(jest:*)
- Bash(pytest:*)
- Bash(git:*)
```

Or add to your `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": ["Edit", "Write", "Bash(npm:*)", "Bash(yarn:*)", "Bash(pnpm:*)", "Bash(test:*)", "Bash(jest:*)", "Bash(pytest:*)", "Bash(git:*)"]
}
```

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow: Explore → Plan → Code

Your preferred workflow optimizes for thoughtful development:

1. **Explore Phase**
   - Ask Claude to read relevant files (don't code yet!)
   - Use subagents for complex investigations
   - Example: "Read the authentication system but don't write code yet"

2. **Plan Phase** 
   - Ask Claude to "think" and create a detailed plan
   - Use "think hard" for complex problems
   - Save plans as documents or GitHub issues for later reference

3. **Code Phase**
   - Implement the planned solution
   - Ask Claude to verify reasonableness as it codes
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Commit Phase**
   - Have Claude create descriptive commit messages
   - Create pull requests with context-rich descriptions

## 👥 Team Collaboration Setup

## 💡 Pro Tips for Claude

1. **Context Management**: Use `/clear` between major features to manage context
2. **Reference Files**: Use @claude-kickstart.md anytime to remind Claude of your setup
3. **Extended Thinking**: Use "think" for planning, "think hard" for complex problems, "think harder" or "ultrathink" for very complex problems
4. **Visual Development**: For UI work, provide screenshots and iterate
5. **Test-Driven**: Run tests frequently - they guide the implementation
6. **Be Specific**: Clear instructions upfront reduce course corrections later
7. **Multi-Claude**: For complex projects, consider running multiple Claude instances in parallel
8. **Course Correct**: Use Escape to interrupt, double-tap Escape to edit history
9. **File References**: Use tab-completion to reference files, paste URLs for docs
10. **Ask Questions**: Ask for clarification if requirements seem ambiguous

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know the setup is correct when:
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] The file structure matches exactly
- [ ] All TypeScript has proper types (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests pass (if any exist)
- [ ] The app deploys successfully
